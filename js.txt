This file contains the fundamentels and conceptual contents about JavaScript and JS-applications.

(Important points)-
	1. <console.log()> is the command that is used to log (print) a massage in the console or terminal. It means to print something
		on the console.
	2. For printing executing JS code inside of the terminal in a code editor like VS-code, then the command <node file_name.js> is
		used.
	3. The statement terminator(;) is used in JS code.
	4. There are 2 of the special values, <null> and <undefined>. There is a difference between both of these. <null> means we know
		whats iniside but currently it is empty. <undefined> means we does not even know what is inisde of this.
	5. Javascript is a dynamically typed programming language. Means we can write anything inside of any variable and we are not 
		supposed to tell what are we trying to write inside of the variable. During the runtime, the interpreter already 
		assigns the data-type of that variable.
	6. Javascript is a case sensitive language, means there is a difference between the uppercase and lowercase value of the same
		letter.
	7. Both the <let> and <cons> keywords are "block-scope keywords".
	8. For finding the type of any value inside of the console, we use the command- <typeof>.
	9. objects in javascript are just like made by normal variable but the main data is in a block format, with key:value pairs.
	10. There are 2 ways of finding the value of any key from an object-- {nameOf_obj.nameOf_key} / {nameOf_obj["nameOf_key"]}.
	11. While having multiple conditioning, we use the if-else and the else-if conditioning. At the end, we use the else condition
		if none of the cases are not satisfied.
	12. There are 2 other ways of conditioning, <switch-case> and <ternary statements>.
	13. An operator that works with only one such variable, are known as <unary operators>.
	    An operator that worls with only two variable are konw as the <binary opeartors>.
	    An operator that works with 3 variable, are known as the <ternary statements> where it is also known as the compact if-else
		statements. (syntax)- <condtition_variable ? "true output_variable" : "false output_variable">.
	14. (alert)- This is a kind of pop-up that appears on an html web-page.
	    (prompt)- This is also a kind of pop-up, but with an additional functionality of temporary input from the user.
	
	15. When we define any for-loop and use the <let> keyword infront of the innitialization variable then that variable would be
		block-scope in the block of that particular loop. But if we use the <var> keyword then we that variable would be 
		global-scope for the whole code itself.
	16. There are 5 kinds of loops in JS- (for loop), (while loop), (do-while loop), (for-of loop) and the (for-in loop).
	17. (for-f loops) cant be used for objects or anyother data set. Though this loop is generally used for strings operations
		and for other string functions.
	18. (for-in loops) always gives us the keys of any object. It is even generally used for object operations. And to return 
		the value of a key as well, we use this, <name_of_the_obj[iterator_variable]>.
	19. Strings are a sequence of characters  to represent text.
	20. There is an another way of making strings, that is by making (template_laterals) and these are created by just by
		replacing <""> with <``> known as (back-ticks). Major functionality about such thing that is, you can make a
		complete string without any addition or concatanation of different segments, and you can also add variables directly
		by (string interpolation) with this placeholder, <${}>.
	21. (string interpolation)- It is a way of adding something in template laterals by placeholders.
	22. (string methods)- These are those functions that are used for perfoming any operation on any string. These are some of 
				the following string methods:
					<str.length()>- This method is used for finding the length of any string.
					<str.toUpperCase()>- This method is used for logging of any string in UPPERCASE format.
					<str.toLowerCase()>- This method is used for logging of any string in lowercase format.
					<str.trim()>- This method is used for logging of any string without any white space.
					<str.charAT(indicis)>- This method is used for logging of the chracter of that string which
								is at that index.
					<str.replace("new_value" : "old_value")>- This method is used for replacing any letter with 
											a new one, in an immutable string.
					<str.repeat(count_value_for_repitition)>- This method is used for logging of that <str> for
											a certain number of times based on the count
											value. Original strings in JS are always 
											immutable and for change, we always use the 
											replacement method.
					<str1.concat(str2)>- This method is used for concatanating a string with another string, 
								instead of the "+" sign.(To do concatanation in a professional way:).

	23. <arrays> are collection of any type of item.

(variable keywords)-
	These are some of the following keywords that are always used before the name of the variable in JS. And these are only 3.
	<let, const and var>.
	(let)- This is current most generally used keyword and is widely used. <let> and <const> keywords are the keys that came after
		the year 2015. And before that, the general keyword used was <var>.
		But if this keyword is used then, the name of that variable cannot be re-declared. Because we already letted a variable
		but we can update.
	(ver)- This the keyword that was generally used before 2015. The only difference is that, if you use this keyword then that 
		variable could be re-declared.
	(const)- This keyword is generally used for integer of float type values for constant values that do not change. The variable 
			used with the const key, cannot be re-declared.

(Data-types)-
	Data types in JavaScript, are mainly of 2 types- "primitive" and "Non-primitive".
	"Primitive" ones are further of 7 types, <Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Binint and Symbol>.
		*When you use the <Bigint()> then at the console, you would see a "n" at the end of the int-type value.
	"Non-primitive" data types are mainly of 3 types. That are- <objects>, <array> and <functions>.

(Logical Operators)-
	There are mainly 3 types of logical operators. These 3 are aplicable to all such programming languages and the syntax is also
	same there. These are <logical AND, &&>, <logical OR, ||> and <logical NOT, !>.
	These operators always returns boolean values(true or false) at the console.
	<&&> would return <true> if both the variables are <true> but if one is <false> then it would return <false> at the console.
	<||> would return <true> if one of the variable is <true>. If both the variables are <false>, then only it would return <false>
	<!> woudl switch the values. This would return <true> for the one with <false> and would return <false> for the one with <true>
		This concept is used mainly used for checking the real world scenariors of the condition checking.
