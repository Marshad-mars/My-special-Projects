This file contains the fundamentels and conceptual contents about JavaScript and JS-applications.

(Important points)-
	1. <console.log()> is the command that is used to log (print) a massage in the console or terminal. It means to print something
		on the console.
	2. For printing executing JS code inside of the terminal in a code editor like VS-code, then the command <node file_name.js> is
		used.
	3. The statement terminator(;) is used in JS code.
	4. There are 2 of the special values, <null> and <undefined>. There is a difference between both of these. <null> means we know
		whats iniside but currently it is empty. <undefined> means we does not even know what is inisde of this.
	5. Javascript is a dynamically typed programming language. Means we can write anything inside of any variable and we are not 
		supposed to tell what are we trying to write inside of the variable. During the runtime, the interpreter already 
		assigns the data-type of that variable.
	6. Javascript is a case sensitive language, means there is a difference between the uppercase and lowercase value of the same
		letter.
	7. Both the <let> and <cons> keywords are "block-scope keywords".
	8. For finding the type of any value inside of the console, we use the command- <typeof>.
	9. objects in javascript are just like made by normal variable but the main data is in a block format, with key:value pairs.
	10. There are 2 ways of finding the value of any key from an object-- {nameOf_obj.nameOf_key} / {nameOf_obj["nameOf_key"]}.
	11. While having multiple conditioning, we use the if-else and the else-if conditioning. At the end, we use the else condition
		if none of the cases are not satisfied.
	12. There are 2 other ways of conditioning, <switch-case> and <ternary statements>.
	13. An operator that works with only one such variable, are known as <unary operators>.
	    An operator that worls with only two variable are konw as the <binary opeartors>.
	    An operator that works with 3 variable, are known as the <ternary statements> where it is also known as the compact if-else
		statements. (syntax)- <condtition_variable ? "true output_variable" : "false output_variable">.
	14. (alert)- This is a kind of pop-up that appears on an html web-page.
	    (prompt)- This is also a kind of pop-up, but with an additional functionality of temporary input from the user.
	
	15. When we define any for-loop and use the <let> keyword infront of the innitialization variable then that variable would be
		block-scope in the block of that particular loop. But if we use the <var> keyword then we that variable would be 
		global-scope for the whole code itself.
	16. There are 5 kinds of loops in JS- (for loop), (while loop), (do-while loop), (for-of loop) and the (for-in loop).
	17. (for-f loops) cant be used for objects or anyother data set. Though this loop is generally used for strings operations
		and for other string functions.
	18. (for-in loops) always gives us the keys of any object. It is even generally used for object operations. And to return 
		the value of a key as well, we use this, <name_of_the_obj[iterator_variable]>.
	19. Strings are a sequence of characters  to represent text.
	20. There is an another way of making strings, that is by making (template_laterals) and these are created by just by
		replacing <""> with <``> known as (back-ticks). Major functionality about such thing that is, you can make a
		complete string without any addition or concatanation of different segments, and you can also add variables directly
		by (string interpolation) with this placeholder, <${}>.
	21. (string interpolation)- It is a way of adding something in template laterals by placeholders.
	22. (string methods)- These are those functions that are used for perfoming any operation on any string. These are some of 
				the following string methods:
					<str.length()>- This method is used for finding the length of any string.
					<str.toUpperCase()>- This method is used for logging of any string in UPPERCASE format.
					<str.toLowerCase()>- This method is used for logging of any string in lowercase format.
					<str.trim()>- This method is used for logging of any string without any white space.
					<str.charAT(indicis)>- This method is used for logging of the chracter of that string which
								is at that index.
					<str.replace("new_value" : "old_value")>- This method is used for replacing any letter with 
											a new one, in an immutable string.
					<str.repeat(count_value_for_repitition)>- This method is used for logging of that <str> for
											a certain number of times based on the count
											value. Original strings in JS are always 
											immutable and for change, we always use the 
											replacement method.
					<str1.concat(str2)>- This method is used for concatanating a string with another string, 
								instead of the "+" sign.(To do concatanation in a professional way:).

	23. <arrays> are collection of any type of item. arrays are completely different from objects. Arrays does not have any 
		key:value duo, the values that are stored inside of arrays are under the umbrellla of a single variable name.
		And arrays are enclosed by third-brackets(square brackets, []). Arrays are are <non-primitive> data type. Despite of
		having difference in between objects but arrays are still considered as speical type of objects. So if you log the 
		<array.typeof()>, then you would get 'object'. And we treat arrays seperately in comparison with objects.
			Values inside of arrays are stored in linear fashion. And each and every value posseses their own unique index 
		value. And they are of a particular length, in respect to the number of values stored in them. But if you try to log a 
		an index that does not exist inside of the array, then you would always get 'undefined' at the console.
			Array values are mutable and can be changed just be rewriting or updating them. So we can say that "Arrays are 
		mutable in compared to strings, who are immutable".
			In arrays position of the value matters, which is known as the index of that value. We can create array of 
		different data-types b4ut we generally prefer to make an array of same data-types.
			We use array in those situation when we want to store multiple values or data in a single variable or storage
		format.
			(These are some of the following array methods and functions)-
				<array.push()>- This method is used to give something... or say to append something inside of an array.
				<array.indexOF()>- This method is used to log the index of any particular array value aat the console.
				<array.pop("arguement or the indicis value")>- This method is used for deleting any array value and then 
										returning at the same time. So it does 2 things, delete 
										and then return.
				<array.toString()>- This method is used to convert an arrya tp string value with all the array values 
							at the place and with same length.
				<array.forEach()>- This mehtod is used to loop through each element(array_value).
				<array.sort()>- This method is used to sort out all the array values and then return at the console.
				<array.reverse()>- This method is used for logging the reverse order of an array.
				<array.isArray()>- This method is used to check that whether an array is array or not or something
							else.
				<array.concat()>- This method is used to merge or concatanate 2 or more arrays at one single array.
				<array.unshift(arguement_value)>- This method is used for appending something at the starting of an
									array and then returning a new one.
				<array.shift()>- This method is used for deleting any starting array value and then returning.
				<array.slice(strting_index, ending_index)>- This method is used for slicing a part of an array. And
										then returning us. This method does not makes any 
										change inside of the original one. We can also use 
										this method to log all the array values, instead of 
										looping over the array for logging. And we can also 
										use this method for making a copy of that array.
				<array.splice(startidx, delCount, newELL)>- This method always makes changes in the original array. It 
										is used for changing the original array(add, remove, 
										replace). It always takes 3 parameters.
				<(forEach)>- forEach is a function type loop for array that automatcally takes each value one by one.
						And then performs the given function on all the values. 
					   This is an array-method as well, that is partuclarly used for arrays. 
					   For this method, the insission of the desired function definition must be given, that would 
						be performing the main work.
					   This method takes the values, one by one from the array  and passes the value to the written
						function definition, into the function parameter. The desired function takes place and 
						this thing continues as a loop till the array length.
					   We generally use arrow function in place of normal function.
						(syntax)-
								array_name.forEach((valu_parameter) => {
									//main_function definition.
									return value_output;
								});
					   This thing could also be written like this-
								funtion array_function(value){
									//do some work;
									return value_output;
								}
								array_name.forEach(array_function());
						Here the main function is written outside the <forEach> method and then the <forEach>
						method is seperately called. By having an entire function as the arguement.
							*Here the <array_function()> is a allback function. That is used as an 
								arguement inside of another function.
					you can use max 3 parameters in forach array method, these are- (value, index and the array)
					(idx) parameter would return the idx of that value on which the operation is being performed.
					(array) parameter returns the whole array with the processed value.
				<(map)>- Its an another type of array method and the modified version of the <forEach array-method>.
						It performs the same function as that of <forEach_method> but it returns the processed
						values in the form of an array. And this method is used inside of a variable, such that
						the processed array could be stored. And then be logged out at any moment.
				<(filter)>- Its an another type of array_method used in JS. Its function is similar to the <map_method>
						but it gives the output under a certain condition that is given inside of this
						function. Where the return statement is written inside of the desired condittion block.
				<(reduce)>- Its an another type of array_method used in JS. It performs over various values and then
						then reduces the array to a single value. And it returns that single value only.
							It takes 2 different parameters, that are (previousValue) and the 
							(currentValue). The (preivos value) parameter is written before the (current
							_value) parameter. 
			*forEach loop are another type of loop type of function method that are specifically used for array objects.
			*(callback)- A callback function is function, passed as an arguement inside of another function.			

	24. (Iterables)- It means, those items any programming language, wjich can be iterated over by a loop. Some of the examples of
				such iterables are- <arrays>,<objects>,<strings> etc...
			Whenever we are dealing with iterables(especially strings,objects or arrays)  we always choose the value for 
			iterator as 0, instead of 1. And keep the range value less then the length of the respective lateral.

	25. We can also use (for-of loop) and (for-in loop) for looping over array values.

	26. (Functions)- Functions are block of code that performs a specific task, and can be invoked whenever needed, amd the way of 
				calling or say invoking a function is known as the "function call". While writing any functions, we
				always add () at the end of the name of the function. It is a way of invoking a function.
				Functions always takes input, processses and then gives us output.
					To write a function, we first make the "function definition", that includes the function key-
				word, known as <function> and then giving a name to the function and then create a block for it.
							function My_function() {
								//function definition content.
							}
				Inside of the () we give inputs, that are known as the parameters. And during the function call, we 
				give the main unput for the function , which is known as the arguement.
					Function also returns values after getting processed up. You can return any type of values.
				If you take the return of multiple values then it would be worthless because functions returns only 
				one value, even which would be the main or the processed value.				
			*Function parameters are local variables and they are block-scope. And that is why, each function has there 
				unique parameters that are only sacred to them.
			(Arrow Functions)- It is the compact way of writing functions. Its syntax is something like this-
							const function = (param1, param2) => {
								//main function, function code.
							}
				*There the implise sign is the "arrow function", that tells whats the input and then what to work.
				*Arrow functions return values gets stored inside of a variable. And the arrow function call is same as
					that of the normal functions.
				*We arrow functions for smaller tasks and they are very reliable for smaller tasks. But for bigger 
					tasks it is important to use sacred functions.

	27. (Redundency)- This word means the repitition of a code or a line of code.
	28. When we associate a function for a specific object, datatype or data structure then that function is termed as method of
		the thing that is used for.
			for example- string methods are specifically used for strings. They are functions, but the specific usage of 
					those functions for strings, makes them methods for strings or termed as methods for strings.
	29. In javascript you can pass a function as a parameter inside of another functon and can be returned.
	30. (Method)- Functions that are binded with and associated with a specific data structure or object or a data type. Then is
			reffered as the method.
	31. (High-ordered functions / methods)- These are those functions that takes other functions as parameters and return the
							processed value. Then thay are termed as higher order functions or method. 
	32. <isNaN()>- This is a special type of function that is used to check whether a variable returns "NaN" or not.
			It has another form, i.e- <!isNaN()>, which is used for checking whether a variable is <number> or not.
	33. When you take the input of anything from prompt then it is always stored in the form of <string>.

	34. It is possible to create a website where all visible content is generated using JavaScript code. But you still need the 
		root HTML plate. In this process, JS uses the DOM-API to create and style everything dynamically. But the correct
		statement here would be- "You can write the entire website logic, structure and even syle through the JS, but a tiny
		HTML shell is required for this". 
						HTML is resposnsible for loading the JS file into the browser, of the html file is 
		absent then the JS code would be worthless. 
	    *(Further information on DOM;Document Object Modeling and DOM manipulation is written down below.You can go and check it
		out).
	35. Front-end devolpment is associated with the 3 musketers of web-development. These are- (HTML), (CSS) and (JavaScript).
	36. For performing any set of task after clicking a button in the HTML, we use the "onclick_attribute". Inside of this 
		attribute, we write the function name that would perform the task. We can also function call up for multiple functions
		in one single click.
			For doing this, we write: <onclick="{function_1(), function_2()...}">
		That is inside of the curly brasis{}, we write the array of performig functions.

(variable keywords)-
	These are some of the following keywords that are always used before the name of the variable in JS. And these are only 3.
	<let, const and var>.
	(let)- This is current most generally used keyword and is widely used. <let> and <const> keywords are the keys that came after
		the year 2015. And before that, the general keyword used was <var>.
		But if this keyword is used then, the name of that variable cannot be re-declared. Because we already letted a variable
		but we can update.
	(ver)- This the keyword that was generally used before 2015. The only difference is that, if you use this keyword then that 
		variable could be re-declared.
	(const)- This keyword is generally used for integer of float type values for constant values that do not change. The variable 
			used with the const key, cannot be re-declared.

(Data-types)-
	Data types in JavaScript, are mainly of 2 types- "primitive" and "Non-primitive".
	"Primitive" ones are further of 7 types, <Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Binint and Symbol>.
		*When you use the <Bigint()> then at the console, you would see a "n" at the end of the int-type value.
	"Non-primitive" data types are mainly of 3 types. That are- <objects>, <array> and <functions>.

(Logical Operators)-
	There are mainly 3 types of logical operators. These 3 are aplicable to all such programming languages and the syntax is also
	same there. These are <logical AND, &&>, <logical OR, ||> and <logical NOT, !>.
	These operators always returns boolean values(true or false) at the console.
	<&&> would return <true> if both the variables are <true> but if one is <false> then it would return <false> at the console.
	<||> would return <true> if one of the variable is <true>. If both the variables are <false>, then only it would return <false>
	<!> woudl switch the values. This would return <true> for the one with <false> and would return <false> for the one with <true>
		This concept is used mainly used for checking the real world scenariors of the condition checking.	

(Document Object Modeling; DOM)-
	the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript is a programming interface that represents an HTML (or XML) document as a 
	structured tree of objects, where each element, attribute, and piece of text is a node that JavaScript can access, modify, add,
	or remove dynamically, allowing scripts to change the content, structure, and style of a web page after it has loaded.
	When a webpage is loaded then browser creates a document object model(DOM) of the page. 

	Its true that we can access all the html code inside of the javascript file. 
		And for acessing such thing, we use the functions-
			<console.log(document.documentElement.outerHTML)>- This logs the whole html code.
			<console.log(document.documentElement.innerHTML)>- This logs only the inner part of the code i.e <head> and 
				<body> sections.
	All the elements we write gets converted into an object in JS. All the elments in the html file gets converted into objects 
	in JS and gets stored inside of the <document> object, in the respective subNode(head, body: div) or the childNode. Where the 
	whole <document> object itself is stored inside of the <window> object.

	Document object is actually a model of our HTML code and the structure of the webpage. Its a kind of hirachial tree that 
	represents this thing~
				-Window
				    -document
					-html
					    -head
						->meta
						->title
						->link, etc...
						->styling sheet or the linked sheet.
					    -body
						->div
						->div
						->various tags and elements
						->script_tag, etc...

		*All these are known as nodes of the DOM tree. The nodes that are inside of the body_node, are known as the
			 (childNodes).
		*To access the childNodes of the body_node then we use this form of commands:
			<console.log(document.body.childNode[node_idx])>.
		*There we control the changes of the web-page by the noding of document through the JavaScript file.

	(childNodes)- Those nodes of elements and tags that are present inside of the body node.
	(window object)- The window object represents an open winow in the browser. Its is the browsers object and it is created 
				automatically by the browser itself. Though it could be the accessed by JS console or the script tag.
				This object contains all the necessary information about the web-site and even the HTML, CSS and JS
				functions, methods, properties etc; inside of it. Where all the functions or methods are actually part 
				of this object. Whenever we create any function then that function also becomes part of the window obj.
					Its a Global object with lots of properties and methods.

	(DOM_Manipulation commands and functions)-

	*Whenever an id based element does not exist then the JS functions, if used then returns null for that unknown id element.
	*<console.dir(name_of_the_object)>- This is a special function, used for logging all the properties or methods of that given 
						object name.
	*For logging the htmlDocument, we use the function- <console.log(window.document)>.
	*The major usage of DOM is-
		1. Doing dynamic changes inside of the web-page.
		2. controling the web-site.
		3. Executing JS functions and writing the logic of the website.
	     ~These things are known as "DOM Manipulation", where it is done through special commands and functions. Such commands and
		functions are listed above.
	*It is possible to create a website where all visible content is generated using javascript, but you sill need the root html
		plate. In this process, Javascript uses the the DOM API to create and style everything dynamically.But the correct 
		statement here would be- "YOu can write the entire website logic, structure and content in JS, but a tiny HTML shell is
		required".
	*For (id) based element, we use the <#> for performing operations on the element. And for (class) based element, we use the <.>
		for performing operatiojn on the element.

(CSS properties)-
	*For add
