This file contains the fundamentels and conceptual contents about JavaScript and JS-applications.

(Important points)-
	1. <console.log()> is the command that is used to log (print) a massage in the console or terminal. It means to print something
		on the console.
	2. For printing executing JS code inside of the terminal in a code editor like VS-code, then the command <node file_name.js> is
		used.
	3. The statement terminator(;) is used in JS code.
	4. There are 2 of the special values, <null> and <undefined>. There is a difference between both of these. <null> means we know
		whats iniside but currently it is empty. <undefined> means we does not even know what is inisde of this.
	5. Javascript is a dynamically typed programming language. Means we can write anything inside of any variable and we are not 
		supposed to tell what are we trying to write inside of the variable. During the runtime, the interpreter already 
		assigns the data-type of that variable.
	6. Javascript is a case sensitive language, means there is a difference between the uppercase and lowercase value of the same
		letter.
	7. Both the <let> and <cons> keywords are "block-scope keywords".
	8. For finding the type of any value inside of the console, we use the command- <typeof>.
	9. objects in javascript are just like made by normal variable but the main data is in a block format, with key:value pairs.
	10. There are 2 ways of finding the value of any key from an object-- {nameOf_obj.nameOf_key} / {nameOf_obj["nameOf_key"]}.

(variable keywords)-
	These are some of the following keywords that are always used before the name of the variable in JS. And these are only 3.
	<let, const and var>.
	(let)- This is current most generally used keyword and is widely used. <let> and <const> keywords are the keys that came after
		the year 2015. And before that, the general keyword used was <var>.
		But if this keyword is used then, the name of that variable cannot be re-declared. Because we already letted a variable
		but we can update.
	(ver)- This the keyword that was generally used before 2015. The only difference is that, if you use this keyword then that 
		variable could be re-declared.
	(const)- This keyword is generally used for integer of float type values for constant values that do not change. The variable 
			used with the const key, cannot be re-declared.

(Data-types)-
	Data types in JavaScript, are mainly of 2 types- "primitive" and "Non-primitive".
	"Primitive" ones are further of 7 types, <Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Binint and Symbol>.
		*When you use the <Bigint()> then at the console, you would see a "n" at the end of the int-type value.
	"Non-primitive" data types are mainly of 3 types. That are- <objects>, <array> and <functions>.
