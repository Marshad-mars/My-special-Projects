Some important points about c++ ~
1. At c++, false is stored as 0 and true is stored as 1 at memory.
2. While showing the cout of false, we get 0 only and for truw we get 1.
3. Boolean values at c++ are not written in capitalized format.
4. Double data type is the double of float data type.

5. (Primitive Data Types)-
        *int (4 bytes)
        *char (1 bytes)
        *float (4 bytes)
        *bool (1 byte)
        *double (8 bytes)

6. Type conversion is an implicit process and casting is an explicit process.
7. Casting of char value to integer value is possible at c++.
8. At c++, char value are only enclosed within single quots.

9. (Garbage Values)- These are those types of values which are empty and when it cout then it would
                        always give us random values.Either it is positive or negative.

10. <cin> and <cout> are not functions rather they are global objects.
11. There are 3 types operators at c++- Arithmatic operators, logical operators and relational operators.

12. (logical operators)- <OR>--> (||)~which is known as pipe~"Logical OR"
                         <AND>--> (&&)~which is also known as double ampersend or just say double-AND~"Logical AND"
                         <NOT>--> (!)~"Logical NOT"

13. At the word Binary, 'Bi' means 2. At the word Unary, 'U' means only 1.

14. (Binary operators)-The type of operator where it at-least uses 2 values to perform any operation.
    (Unary operator)-The type of operator where is uses only 1 value to perdorm any operation.

15. Incriment unary operator-> ++
    Decrement unary operator-> --

16. (a++) or (a--)-> first performs the operation then update.It is known as post-increment operator.
    (++a) or (--a)-> first update then perform the operation.It is known as pre-increment operator.

17. <else-if> is used with <if> and <else> if there are multiple conditionals then it is used.
18. Uppercase character ascii value is 65 to 96 and Lowercase character ascii value is 97 to 122.
19. ASCII stands for "American Standerd Code of Information Interchange".
20. (Ternary statements)- Here Ternary means 3. Ternary statement is nothing but a single statement 
                            version of conditionals.It is followed by <?> for the condition.And different 
                            statement based on a condition are seperated by the <:>.
                                eg-  int m = 3;
                                     m < 5 ? "pos" : "neg";

                    (syntax of writing turnary statements)-
                            variable_name = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;

                            *This type of statement is generally used for <if-else> condition but if <else if>
                                is also needed then it is not used in action.
                            *Actually ternary statements are for if...ekse condition. As main condition are of only true or fasle 
                                values i.e <if> or <else>. So ternary statements are nothing but simpified way of writing if...else 
                                condition
                            *It is possible to write nested ternary statements-conditions and their respective return value 
                                inside of one single variable.
                    (A sample syntax of the ternary statement code)- c++ code-
                            int marks;
                            cout << "Enter student's marks: ";
                            cin >> marks;
                            string return_val = (marks >= 90) ? "~Student has got A":
                                                (marks >= 80) ? "~Student has got B":
                                                (marks >= 70) ? "~Student has got C":
                                                (marks >= 60) ? "~Student has got D": "~Student has faild the test...";
                            cout << return_val << endl;

22. At c++, there are 3 types of loops- <while>loop, <for>loop and <do-while>loop.

21. Example syntax of whil,for and do-while loop-
        (while-loop)~                       (for-loop)~                   do{
        while(i <= 5){                      for(int j=0; j<=5; j++){         //process
            cout << i << endl;                  cout << j << endl;        }while(i <= 5);  //condition
            i++;                            }
        }
    *At while, the out return is alsways shown at vertical manner but if the user wants to output return
        horizontal manner then this statement is written-> <cout << i << " ";>.

22. camelCase is a type of case of naming of variables where the first word of the identifier is small case and the second 
        word of the identifier is at Uppercase where the words are not seperated by a space.

23. do-while loop performs the operation first then checks the condition.
24. C++ has built-in function for finding factorial of any any number.It is factorial().
25. At both C or C++, a return value of 0 means success(<return 0;>) and return value of 1 means failiure(<return 1;>).
26. factorial is denoted by the symbol <!> with that number-> <n!> this is n factorial.
27. Patterns are those types of special program which are made up of loops and nested loops only.
28. In continuous pattern problems, we take a variable and store the last progress done by every iteration then start with that value at the next iteration.
29. In c++, you cannot directly compare C-style strings with == for condition check. Instead you need to use the <strcmp()> the <cstring>library Or just include the string-
        library and use the string data type instead of char data type.

30. (Arrays)-Arrays are considered to be the first Data Structures.
                *Data storers are of different different types and those different formats of storage of data is known as data structure, like arrays which 
                    which strores data is a type of data structures.
                *At arrays, each block of code occupies a space of 4 bytes.
                *At c++, size() and sizeof() gives us different outputs. 
                    size() gives us the length of array. 
                    sizeof() gives us the memory occupied by the array.
            
            (Properties of arrays)~
                1. We can store data only of same type of data type at every block of an array.
                2. Arrays are contiguous in memory.
                3. Arrays are lenear(straight line structures).
                4. Every block of an array occupies a space of a single integer.
                5. If we want to initialize the size of an array to a fixed length then we can or if we dont then there is no problem(according to the length of the array, the size would be initialized).

31. (Algorithms)- It is a form of efficient method of performing operation on a particular set of data. Those diffrent methods are 
                    known as algorithms. It is also a method of searching of data i.e is only an operation.

32. In c++, positive infinity is written as <INT_MAX> and the negative infinity is written as <INT_MIN>.

33. There is a built in function for checking that whether a string contains alphanumeric characters or not. 
	syntax- <isalnum()>.

34. There is a built in function for converting a uppercase character to lower case. <tolower()>.

35. In c++ for representing the <n> factorial, we represent it as <n!> means to take the product of all the values from 1 ro n.

36. Based on the context of c++, memory is of two types, stack and heep.

37. When all the operations and execution is performed after returning all the desired output, all the stack frames are erased hence,
        all the memory is cleared and ready for next code.

38. Copy of arguement by different place holders(different variables) or same palce holders(same variables) is passed to 
        function is known as "Pass by Value" and "Pass by Reference",respectively.

39. <const>type is used before any data type variable or value to make it completely constant type means even initialization would not
            change the value of that variable even it is <int>, <float> etc. If it is initialized then compiler would show us an error.

40. A variable identifier with all caps idicates that the variable value is a constant, a lateral value.

41. For finding whether a number is prime or not, four conditions must be checked~
        if n <= 1, then it is not prime number.
        if n % 2 or n % 3 != 0, then it is a prime number.
        if n % 2 or n % 3 == 0, then it is not a prime number.
        if n == 2 or n == 3, then it is a prime number.
    *But there are certain numbers which are not divisible by 3 and 2 but then also they are not prime.

*Unary operators has the highest presedencies, then comes the arithmatic operators, then comes the relatioal operators, then comes 
    the logical operators and then at last comes the assignment operator. But of all of these, () has the highest amount of 
    presedency among all of the operators. This way of overwriting is used for overwriting the rules.
*It is possible to create block of code in c++ like javascript, inside of curly bracis.
*We can also change the meaning or say modify data type in c++.
*In Linux based operating system, size of <long int> and <long long int> is absolutely same and equal where there is no difference.
*Space and size of the <int> or anyother type of data type completely depends upon the system itself. It is not fixed in nature.
*Data type modifiers are very important because these adjusts the size and the nature of a variable increasing the overall size 
    and storage capacity of the system making it more reliable.
*To convert an int value to string, use this method: 
            c++ code~ <string value = to_string(abs(num))

*C++ statements are nothing but the each and every line of code that we write in the program. Where each and every line of c++
    statement must have a statement terminator i.e  ";".
*<char> and <boolean> data types are considered to be the only data types which occupies a storage of only 1 byte.
*Booleans are most used for condition testing.
*Float and double data type has one primary difference that of the storage capacity and occupation.
*Only characters are enclosed under single quotes and strings are enclosed under double quotes.
*Concatanation is only possible in srring variables, not at cout-global object. And we can also concatanate strings wit the help
    of <append()>.

*C++ uses (+) operator for both addition of int values and for concatanation for string values.

(*). In c++, double-right angular brackets i.e (>>) are known as "Extraction operator" and the double-left angular brackets i.e (<<)
        are knwon as "Insertion operator".
(*). <cin> is a global object and it considers whitespaces or tab spaces, so if we enter any multiple word value or say a sentence 
        then it would store the first single word inside of the given variable. 
            For example- if you cin "Hello world!" inside of the vriables <string greetings;> then it would store only the 
                            "Hello" word inside of the vriable greetings and if we take the cout of the vriable greetings then 
                            it would only show us <Hello> at the output. And to prevent this, we use the <getline()>. About 
                            getline() is written at the built-in functions section.

* Functions like <sqrt()>, <round()> and <log()> comes with the <cmath> standard library. These are some of the built-in functions 
        which comes with <cmath> standard library.
* The boolean value- <true> would always give us binary-(1), which signifies <yes> statement. And the boolean value- <false> would 
        always give us the binary-(0), which signifies <no> statement.
*Boolean values are used for building logic and finding solution of different types of problems. Booleans are the basis of all the 
        c++ comparison and conditions.

(*). <if> condition is used for specifying any condition to find whether it is <true>. 
     <else> is used when the condition is <false> i.e if the <if> condition is returns <false>.  
     <else if> condition is used after <if> and before <else>. It is used only if the previous condition returns <false>, i.e we 
            can also use <else if> after another <else if> if the previous <else if> have a chances of returning <false>.
    <switch> is used for checking many alternative block of conditions. Where we specify the block of conditions as "cases".
                In <switch> condition, if evry cases are false then we use the <default> case where we specify that the user have 
                entered something which is out of the context of the <switch> cases.

                    Switch case conditioning always needs a an int type values for its case value, for example <case 9>, which means 
                    if the main expression returns 9 then this case would be implemented.

(*). <break> and <default> keywords are optional in the switch cases conditioning. In switch case conditioning, we cant give the 
        direct constant for a complex situation, rather we need to enter an expression at the switch(), not a direct constant.

{C++ built-in-functions}~~
    1. In c++, we are provided with built function for finding the maximum or minimum between any number or say values in an array of nums.
            For comparing about the maximum value, we use the <max()>. And for minimum is <min()>.

    2. <count()>- For using this function, first the algorithm library must be included.THis function could be used for counting the number of occurence of a particular
                    number in an array.

    3. <find()>- This function is used for finding the indicis of any particular number. For using this we iterate from the begining to end 
                    and then the target is declared. For using this function, first algorithm library must be included.
                            (syntax)-    int* idx_cont = find(begin(array_nums), end(array_nums), small_val);  

    4. <change()>- This funciton could be sued for changing the value of any variable at its original format. This is widely used at 
                        functions specially at Pass by Reference.       

    5. <lower()>- This function is used to convert an upper case character into lower case character.  

    6. <isalnum()>- This function is used to check whether a string contains alphanumeric characters or not.

    7. <sqrt()>- For using this function, first the cmath library must be added. This function 
                    could be used for finding the square root of any number. This function is only found in <cmath> standard library
                    therefore, first the <cmath> standard library must be included first and then the function must eb called out.

    8. <append()>- This function is generally used for strings, where it is used for joining different strings together.

    9. <sizeof(array) / sizeof(int)>- This type of operation on the combination of function is used for finding the lenght of an 
                                        array. <sizeof(array)> gives us the whole size of an array in bytes and then we divide 
                                        the <sizeof(int)> size of individual value to the whole, to find the total number of int 
                                        values.

    10. <length()>- This function is only used for finding the lenght of any string. It is written like this-
                        <"variable_name".length()>.
                    *We can also <size()> for finding the lenght of a string. Both <length()> and <size()> have same function and 
                        would return the same value only. But the main difference comes in the way of writing the function.
                            <length()> is written like this-> <"variable_name".length()>
                            <size()> is written like this-> <size("variable_name")>

    11. <at()>- It is a built-in function that comes with the <string> library. It is used for accessing any alphabet inside of a 
                    string, including the white spaces.

    12. <getline()>- This function is used for taking the input of a whole line or sentences or say group of words, including 
                        whitespacs or tab-spaces, by the help of <cin>. <cin> is taken as the first parameter and the <"variable">
                        is taken as the second parameter, sperated by comma. As <cin> alone cannot take the input of a group of 
                        words compared to the <getline()>.
                                c++ code~
                                        string name;
                                        cout << "Please enter your first name: ";
                                        getline(cin, name);
                                        cout << "your full name is: " << name << endl;
                        *It is for this reason, <getline()> is named as "getline".
                        *<cin> can store only single word inside of a variable but <getline()> can store multiple words inside of 
                            a variable by taking the <cin> as the first parameter and the variable as the second parameter.
                        *We say the way of using a <getline()> as "reading/read a line".

    13. <max()>- This is a math based function which is used for finding the greatest value between any 2 int or float values.
    14. <min()>- This is also a math based function which is used for finding the smallest value between any 2 int or floar values.

    15. <log()>- This function is used for finding the log of any value, which is related to the logarithms. This function is a
                    built-in function of <cmath> standard library. So for using it, <cmath> standard library must be included.

    16. <round()>- This function is used for finding the round-of value of any given number. This function is a built-in function 
                        of <cmath> standard library. So for using it, <cmath> standard library must be included.

{Functions}~

(syntax of a function)- 
        returntype printhello(){
            //operation.
        }
        here, <returntype> is the type of data which we are returning from a function. <printhello()> is the name of the function.
    1. Functions which does not return anything, the there return type must becout << "Greater: " << sum(10, 5) << endl; <void>.
    2. A function does not works until and unless we do not call the function. That is function call or say function invoke.
    3. The Inputing of any variable inside of a function is known as parameters.

{unique points and definition}-
    (*).(Fibonacci)- The process of increasing of list of numbers in such a way that the next number is greater
                        the previous number by its own value.
    *(Presedencies)- Presedencies in c++ is known as priority. which means the importance of operators like the modulus operator
                        would generally have more priority then division operator.
    *(Incrimentation)- The way of incrimenting an int value by 1.
    *(Decrimentation)- The way of decrimenting an int value by 1.

    (*). (c-Style strings)- It is the way of writing c-style strings in c++ except of using the <string> library, by using the 
                                <char> type variable with a fixed length.
                                    For exmaple- c++ code~
                                                        char name[35] = "Hello world! It is a c-style string with a definite length";
                            *It is an array of characters, presented in the form of strings.
                            *c-style strings are called or created by calling an <char> array.
                            *c++ supports both standard strings and c-style strings(it is because- c++ is nothing but an extension of C).
                            *You can also define the length of c-style string as undefined by not declaring any value inside of any variable.
                                But the twist is that we can take any input of that undefined length c-style string, rather can store any 
                                string.

{About Binary number system}-
    1. The number 10 is only known as "dec" at the decimal terminology.
    2. Number system are of numerous types but all of them, Binary number system is the most prominent one. 
    3. For conversion from decimal to binary, we need to repeatedly divide any number by 2.
    4. The coded format of any binary number system have some tricks to solve- The solution is mainly based the modulu or say the remeinder
            of the continuous repitition of the division of 2 with the next remeinder.
    5. The last bit of every odd binary numbers would always be 1, and the last bit of every even binary numbers would alsways
            be 0.
    6. The negative form of a number is stored trough a series of steps, by one's complement and two's complement process.
            flipping of a binary number is known as one's complement, i.e one's complement of (1010)-which is nothing but decimal 
            number 10 would be (10101). And the two's complement of this number is- (10110) and it is nothing but the addition 
            of 1 at the last bit of the binary number so formed( by the one's complement) which would result in 2 and further 
            2 would be converted into its binary form, the resultent value after one's and two's compelment would be the binary 
            format of that negative number which would be further stored inside of the number.
    7. The gven binary number could only be identified whther it is negative or not, just by looking at the first bit of the 
            number. If the first bit is (1) then it is a negative value and if the first bit is (0) then it is a positive value.

{C++ standard libraries}-
    (<bitset>)- <bitset> is a C++ Standard Library header that allows you to represent fixed-size binary sequences — like 
                    a string of bits (0s and 1s). It gives us an easy way to print the binary version of a number. It could be 
                    used for finding the binary value of both negative as well as positve values. 
                *The syntax of using it like this-
                                            c++ code~ [bitset<32> binary(num);] 
                    Inside of the angular brackets, we give the fixed size of the binary sequence. and then use the binary
                    function to convert the decimal value to its binary form.
                *The above syntax is not enclosed under any variable. Inside of the binary() we write the name of the variable
                    inside of the function and return the binary itself , i.e-> <return binary;>. If the name f the variable 
                    is given besides the return statement then the desired output would not come.
                *If the whole conversion process is enclosed inside of a function then the return type of the function would 
                    not be <int>, rather it would be- c++ code~ (bitset<"fixed size"> binary_converter(int value){}).

    (<string>)- It is a standard library which used for including the data type <string> for longer sequence character statements.
                    Bu including this, we can also perform different operations on strings as there is no built-in data type for 
                    string type values.

    (<typeinfo>)- It is a standard library which is used for having the power of using the <typeid().name()>. This function is 
                    generally used for finding the type of any variable as c++ does not have any built-in function for finding the 
                    type of any variable.

    (<cmath>)- The <cmath> standard library in C++ provides a collection of functions for performing common mathematical 
                    operations like trigonometry, exponentiation, logarithms, rounding, absolute values, and more. It is standard 
                    library which could function special mathematical functions.

{Bitwise operations}-
    *Bitwise operations is the operations performed on binary numbers.
    *The <logical AND> of binary values is known as <bitwise AND>. It is because we are performing a bitwise operation of logical 
        AND of the given binary values.
    *Bitwise operations have different symbols for their function. Like the <bitwise AND> is denoted as (&)- except (&&). And 
        the <bitwise OR> is denoted as (|) except (||).
    *If we enter any and perform bitwise operations then first the values are converted into their binary form and then the main
        operations is performed.
    (Some of the following bitwise operators)-
        <bitwise &>(bitwise AND)
        <bitwise |>(bitwise OR)
        <bitwise ^>(exclusive XOR)
        <bitwise << >(bitwise left shift)
        <bitwise >> >(bitwise right shift)

    *<bitwise ^> is not known as bitwise XOR, rather it is known as <exclusive XOR>. In this type of operation, we say-
        (0 ^ 0)= 0 and (1 ^ 1)= 0
        (0 ^ 1)= 1 and (1 ^ 0)= 1
            Means if there are same values, then only the resultent value would be (0) and if there are no same values then the 
            resultent value would (1).
    *<bitwise << > This operator results in the shift of the bits of binary value to i times of a binary value n to their left 
                        side, by i th places.
                    *This bitwise operator does a special function at memory. It follows the calculation of (a * 2^b). Here, 
                        (a) is the decimal number that we give and (b) is the number of places that should be shifted to the left-
                        listed in numbers. The following expression results is the final value that a bitwise left shift operator
                        allocates at the memory.
    *<bitwise >> > This operator results in the shift of the bits of binary value to i times of a binary value n to their right 
                        side, by i th places.
                    *This bitwise operator also does a special function at memory. It follows the calculation of (a / 2^b). Here, 
                        (a) is the decimal number that we give and (b) is the number of places that should be shifted to the right-
                        listed in numbers. The following expression results is the final value that a bitwise left shift operator 
                        allocates at the memory.


{escape sequence characters}-
    1. <\n>- This character is used for making a new line at the output.
    2. <\t>- This character is used for making a tab space between characters wherever you put in between, which would show its 
                effects at the output only.
    3. <\" --content-- \">- It is also written as <\"> in short. It is used for enclosing any part of string under double quots 
                                which shows its effects at the output only.
    4. <\\>- This sequence enters a single back slash inside of a string at the output.
