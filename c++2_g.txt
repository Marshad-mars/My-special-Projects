This is the second plane for the c++ too book where everyting would be organized in a flow and in an 
arranged format. This is the second version of the c++.txt but in an organized format~

1. {Normal points and facts}-
    * The standard library of of <iostream> stands for (input/output standard).
    * <cout> and <cin> are global objects.
            <cout>- stands for (character out).
            <cin>- stands for (character in).
    * In programming, (*) and (/) have a higher priority then (+) and (-). This thing is known as order of operators.
        Though this order could be changed by the help of parenthisis.
    * (<<)- This operator is known as "Stream Insertion Operator".

2. {keywords}-
    *<const>- It is a keyword which is used to convert any changable value i.e a variable to a non-changable vaue i.e constant.

3. {variable or constants naming convention}-
    *There are various types of cases for naming-
        (snake case)- int file_size;
        (pascal case)- int FileSize;
        (camel case)- int fileSize;
        (hungarian notation)- int iFileSize;  //this case is a very old type of cases used in earlier times.

        *Snake, camel and pascal cases are some of the most popular types of cases.
