It would contain all the infomation in an organized format. Divided into different different sections.

1. {Facts and other points}-
        * It is possible to use curly brasis in python. The main advantage of it is that it could be used to overcome the identation in
                python.
        * For opening the command palette, press- <shift + ctrl + p>.
        *Actually python code is not directed interpreted but first turned into a machine code then that bytecode is interpreted 
                by some further operations.
        *In indexing we can access any character or any value occupied there but can not perform any operation there at the pace of it.
2. {definitions}-
        (Linting)- The word "linting" refers to the process of analyzing source code to find potential errors, bugs, stylistic 
                        issues, or suspicious constructs.
        (Concatanation)- It is a way of joining strings together by operator like (+).
        (slicing)- It is a way of accessing parts of a string.
                        *In slicing, we can do this- <[:]> for slicing the whole string which is ultimately printing it or
                                also do this-> <[_:]> where (_) is the place of index.
        (Presidencies)- It is the degree or say the authority of the fundamental mathematical symbols.
