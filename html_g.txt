These are some of the following points about HTML.
1. (Attributes)- Attributes are used to add some more information about an html tag.
2. <!DOCTYPE html>- is used to tells our browser to open a custom web-page for us and also to tell it whether which type of version
                        of html we are using for this purpose.
3. (viewport)- means to show us our own custom web-page site.

        1. (<pre> </pre>)- This type of tags are used to display text as it is(without ignoring spaces and next line). 
                                *This tag actually writes in such a way that the text is as it is like a type-writer format style.
                                *This tag also lets us to format as like we want, if we want to include 100 spaces then it would allow us
                                but other tags would not allow us this feature. 
        2. (<section>  </section>)- It is used for dividing the main page into different sections on your page.

                                        the main content of the web-page.
        5. (<span>  </span>)- Span tag is also container like div used for other HTML elements. It takes the required amount of space only.

{important meanings and definitions}-
        1. (layouts in html)- In HTML, layouts refer to the way elements are arranged on a webpage. 
        2. (inline)- The tags or element which takes space(height or width) as per required and needed are known as inline elements.
                        eg. <span>tag.
        3. (lists)- Lists are used to represent real life list data. At html, lists are of two  types, unordered and ordered lists.,

{unique points}-
        (*). Proper layouts of the page must be maintained and in a properly arranged format.
        (*). semantic tags must be used and in a Proper way. This ability also enhances the programmers's experience.
        (*). (%) with the numeric value is used to set the width of a div container.
        (*). <display: flex;> results in the showcase of contant in horizontal format and <display: block;> results in the showcase of
                        contant in vertical format. Flex arranges the content or element side by side side and block shows the element or 
                        content one after another on the web page.
        (*). By default, at html, the aspect ratio of width and height is like this-> {width * height}.
        (*). Span tag would do its role only if it is not styled by css or any other type of tags like header or highlighting tags. 
                But if the styling tags or highlighting tags are used outside the span tag, then styling or highlighting of the content 
                would be done as well as span tag would full fill its role.

                                content inside of any Non-empty tag.

{special commands}-
        * for formatting the code, press-> <ctrl + s + s>. In this editor, prettier formatter is installed and default.
             The way it would format the code is the original way of formatting of any HTML code. 
             ~The double tick sign shows that prettier formatter is acrivated in the current code.
             ~The null sign (circle with a slash inside of it) shows that the prettier formatter is not activated at the current code.
