1. (Attributes)- Attributes are used to add some more information about an html tag.
2. <!DOCTYPE html>- is used to tells our browser to open a custom web-page for us and also to tell it whether which type of version
                        of html we are using for this purpose.

        1. (<pre> </pre>)- This type of tags are used to display text as it is(without ignoring spaces and next line). 
                                *This tag actually writes in such a way that the text is as it is like a type-writer format style.
                                *This tag also lets us to format as like we want, if we want to include 100 spaces then it would allow us

                                        the main content of the web-page.
        5. (<span>  </span>)- Span tag is also container like div used for other HTML elements. It takes the required amount of space only.

        3. (lists)- Lists are used to represent real life list data. At html, lists are of two  types, unordered and ordered lists.,

{unique points}-
        (*). Proper layouts of the page must be maintained and in a properly arranged format.
        (*). semantic tags must be used and in a Proper way. This ability also enhances the programmers's experience.
        (*). (%) with the numeric value is used to set the width of a div container.
        (*). <display: flex;> results in the showcase of contant in horizontal format and <display: block;> results in the showcase of
                        contant in vertical format. Flex arranges the content or element side by side side and block shows the element or 
                        content one after another on the web page.
        (*). By default, at html, the aspect ratio of width and height is like this-> {width * height}.
        (*). Span tag would do its role only if it is not styled by css or any other type of tags like header or highlighting tags. 
                But if the styling tags or highlighting tags are used outside the span tag, then styling or highlighting of the content 
                would be done as well as span tag would full fill its role.
        (*). <padding> is the distance between an element to other elements. <margin> is the distance between the element-contents 
                and the border of that element. These properties are mainly used for edtiting a <div>.
        (*). The <top>, <left>, <right>, and <bottom> properties in CSS are used to control the exact position of an element only when its position is set to relative, absolute, or fixed, and they work by shifting the element from its normal place

{special tools for web-dev}-
        1. (remove back-ground)- This app or website could be used for removing the background of any image and just give us the objected 
                                image of the original image.

                                flow; it changes how the element appears on the screen while keeping its original position in the 
                                layout, making it extremely useful for animations, transitions, interactive effects, and creative UI design.

        4. (animation)- the animation property in CSS is used to make elements change or move over time by applying keyframes, 
                                allowing you to create smooth, automated visual effects like fades, slides, rotations, or color 
                                changes without needing JavaScript.
