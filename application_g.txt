Intriduction about computers~

Computer is an elctronic device which is used for taking some input, some processes and gives some output. These 3 are the only
primary functioion which is made for them. Because of this advancement in technology, computer machines are evolving and taking new
forms. 
*Computer stands for(based on the old edition)- Common Operating Machines Purposely used-for Technical, Educational and Research.
At present computer is primarily used in various fields with higher priority. Computer is nothing but a high speed computer.
A computer has various characteristics like speed, accuracy, storage,

(Computer Architecture)- 
	~A  computer is mainly divided into different units of 3 in total. 

	<Input unit>- This unit is dedicated with the input systems and sectors of the computer.
	<Processing/ Control unit>- This unit is dedicated with the processign and control of the data and the computer, 
					respectively. It is divided into 3 different parts-
					(Control unit)- It controls the whole system.
					(ALU)- It stands for Arithmatic Logic Unit. Its main purpose is for decission making and 
						performing various calculations.
					(Internal memory)- This unit is dedicated for storing of the information pf the CPU.
								There the RAM and ROM comes under this unit only.
	<Output unit>- This unit is dedicated with the output and show of the iformation or data on the screen.
	
	*<Main memory> and <Secondary storage> are not part of Contrl Unit, though these two are connected with all the other units.

(Important points)-
	* AI chat bots are devoloped mainly on the basis of given information and provided data for modal training purposes. There we 
		provide data to the modal and on the basis of that it get trained, results in better purformences.
	*Less storage capacity is not a characteristics of computer, rather it depends upon the amount of data being stored.
	*Computer mainly follows the cycle of IPO(Input Processing Output).
	*<Control unit>- Controls each and every part of the computer.

(Definitions and Terminology)-
	(Softcopy)- The final output on the screen of a computer is known as softcopy.
	(Hardcopy)- The final output which is printed is known as Hardcopy.
	(Software)- It is a set of instructions that tells the system to what to do. It is divided into 3 catagories-
			<System software>-
			<Utility software>-
			<Application software>-
